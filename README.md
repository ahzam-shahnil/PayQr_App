In todayâ€™s world, commerce truly has no borders. Customers and revenue can come from anywhere, which opens new doors for both established industry players and emerging SMBs (small and midsize business).
Pakistan is one of the many countries which is growing very fast in the IT sector and people here are quickly adopting the new technologies for their ease. But still in this era of IT there is no special payment system through which users can pay cashless with ease except for big shopping malls etc. Local SMBs do not have access to the latest payment gateway.
There are different apps for Digi Khata, qrcode scan and generator, barcode scanner. No app provides all these functionalities into one app.
